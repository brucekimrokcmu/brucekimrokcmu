Hello, my name is Bruce Kim.<br>
Currently, I am contributing to [SHARK-Turbine](https://github.com/nod-ai/SHARK-Turbine/),a unified build of IREE, torch-mlir, and auxilliary support for providing a tight integration with PyTorch and other related frameworks.  <br>

I studied Robotic Systems Development at [Robotics Institute, Carnegie Mellon University](https://mrsd.ri.cmu.edu/) in 2023.<br>

In 2022, I worked at [ESTAT ACTUATION](https://www.estat.tech/) as a Summer Intern, and designed a prototype of an exoskeleton ankle sprain prevent system.<br> 
Before coming to CMU, I was an electric vehicle project manager at [LG Energy Solution](https://www.lgensol.com/en/index), and my main projects include launching batteries for [Volvo's XC40 Recharge](https://www.volvocars.com/us/cars/xc40-electric/) and [Polestar 2](https://www.polestar.com/us/polestar-2/?gclid=Cj0KCQjwgO2XBhCaARIsANrW2X2YTRw3fGUYTmroSBMY-6JWCbTPU8DjG0GSLgrXD-qB-aOnBHXe-UYaAqEvEALw_wcB).<br>

My robotics projects include the followings: <br>

>1. Vertical Farming Automation - Using a mobile manipulator to pollinate and harvest tomatoes<br>
  I was responsible for implementing manipulation and project management in the Spring 22. <br>
  I am responsible for perception - detecting tomato clusters using YOLO V5 and TensorRT for real-time inference in the Fall 22. <br>
>2. Advanced Dynamics and Simulation
  Simulating advanced dynamics in robotics such as satellite in a orbit, attitude dynamics, a glider, hanging cable (catenary) problem ...etc)
>3. Planning - search-based method, sampling-based method
>4. Deep learning - Using PyTorch to implement Attention-based Speech Recognition, face recognition & verification, and reimplementing CLIPort for vision-language manipulation ...etc
>5. Lego Kitting - using Franka Arm to autonomously conduct lego kitting<br>
  I was responsible for implementing manipulation with Alex Pletta. <br>
>6. Kinematics, Dynamics, and Controls <br>
  Course projects on implementing various aspects of manipulation. <br>
  A research project in modeling a tree in a mass-spring-damper system to observe its behavior against an external force such as wind. <br>
>7. Computer Vision <br>
  Course projects on implementing computer vision algorithms and applications. <br>
