Hello, my name is Bruce Kim.<br>
Currently, I am a graduate student studying Robotic Systems Development at [Robotics Institute, Carnegie Mellon University](https://mrsd.ri.cmu.edu/).<br>
In 2022, I worked at [ESTAT ACTUATION](https://www.estat.tech/) as a Summer Intern, and designed a prototype of an exoskeleton ankle sprain prevent system.<br> 
Before coming to CMU, I was an electric vehicle project manager at [LG Energy Solution](https://www.lgensol.com/en/index), and my main projects include launching batteries for [Volvo's XC40 Recharge](https://www.volvocars.com/us/cars/xc40-electric/) and [Polestar 2](https://www.polestar.com/us/polestar-2/?gclid=Cj0KCQjwgO2XBhCaARIsANrW2X2YTRw3fGUYTmroSBMY-6JWCbTPU8DjG0GSLgrXD-qB-aOnBHXe-UYaAqEvEALw_wcB).<br>

My robotics projects include the followings: <br>

>1. Vertical Farming Automation - Using a mobile manipulator to pollinate and harvest tomatoes<br>
  I was responsible for implementing manipulation and project management in the Spring 22. <br>
  I will be responsible for perception in the Fall 22. <br>
>2. Advanced Dynamics and Simulation
  Simulating advanced dynamics in robotics such as satellite in a orbit, attitude dynamics, a glider, hanging cable (catenary) problem ...etc)
>3. Deep learning - implementing PyTorch from scratch and using it for projects such as frame-level speech recognition, face recognition & verification, ...etc
>4. Lego Kitting - using Franka Arm to autonomously conduct lego kitting<br>
  I was responsible for implementing manipulation with Alex Pletta. <br>
>5. Kinematics, Dynamics, and Controls <br>
  Course projects on implementing various aspects of manipulation. <br>
  A research project in modeling a tree in a mass-spring-damper system to observe its behavior against an external force such as wind. <br>
>6. Computer Vision <br>
  Course projects on implementing computer vision algorithms and applications. <br>
>7. Programming Familiarization <br>
  Implementing a basic AI algorithm in C++ to avoid missiles autonomously. <br>
  Familiarizing with ROS nodes, messages, services,communication systems, and various ROS packages.
